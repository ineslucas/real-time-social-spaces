# Followed a 2 hour tutorial from Three.js Journey, which still needs debugging. Feels like a direct interaction with the environments texture. This displacement animation technique also allows us to understand the mechanics of triggering any changes in a texture, which is why I wanted to try it. There was currently no intended movement through the scene - to do that, you drag. mouseMove allows for a simple interaction.

## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
