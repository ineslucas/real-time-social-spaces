Running server locally for testing:

npm i // for the first time
node server.js
ngrok http 8080 // or your port number to which your server is connected - on a new terminal window

Issues that I'm trying to solve:
- Microphone not working.


Issue for office hours:
- Getting the GaussianSplats 3JS library to work on my project.


Future features:
- Make blobs work with mouse
- WebRTC and etc connection to microphone
- Messages that youâ€™re connected
- HTML Overlays
- Add gaussian flowers as background?
